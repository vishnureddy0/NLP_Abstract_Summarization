# State-of-the-art NLP Abstract Summarization in Deep Learning
Back in 2020 as my first NLP Data Scientist role, I leveraged cutting-edge transformer models in NLP to solve business challenges at one of my previous firms. 

It was before the LLM boom that pre-trained models were just on the rise- leveraging them to help one of the largest news media firms was a great experience!

Please find the code that I used that essentially outlines my effort in large-scale abstract summarization of long-content format into byte-size content using transformer algorithms in ML like BERT and T5.
